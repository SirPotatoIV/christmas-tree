# HTML/CSS Christmas Tree
Making a Christmas tree with only HTML and CSS. Winter break coding practice.

## Description 
While on winter break our instructor provided us with optional prompts. The first was to make a christmas tree using only HTML and CSS. Cheated a little bit by using a gif to cause the ornaments to sparkle. Overlayed identical shapes and made the gif slightly transparent.

## Images

## Installation 
Keep all files in a single folder and do not move files around within the folder.

## Usage 
This was primarily made to attempt to complete the extra challenge my instructor provided over break.

## Credits 
I created this code based on a prompt created by my web dev bootcamp instructor. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the html and css.

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but I got a lot of help from all the interwebz.

## Challenges
I struggled trying to decide how to position the lights and the ornaments. I wanted to use flex instead of grid for these elements, but struggled with flex displaying for some reason. Decided to use grid instead. The other challenge was getting the ornaments to sparkle. The solution I went with was overlapping 2 identical divs. One of the divs has a gif as the background image, which I set the opacity to 50%.
